/**
 * Project Euler: Problem 2
 * Even Fibonacci numbers
 * https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
 *
 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is
 * generated by adding the previous two terms. By
 * starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 *
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
 * whose values do not exceed four million, find the
 * sum of the even-valued terms.
